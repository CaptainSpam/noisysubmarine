# Noisy Submarine
An OpenSubsonic client for Android devices

This is an Android app that does all sorts of fun OpenSubsonic stuff to play audio files from a remote server.  Eventually, I mean.  Right now it's in the really early stages of development.

It also doubles as me learning modern Android development techniques and libraries (as opposed to the old-school Android code I'm more used to), so there's that.  Give it time.
